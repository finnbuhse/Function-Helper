# Function-Helper

Description:
Enables users to calculate the value, gradient, roots, and also plot a function of thier choice.

There is a specific syntax that is supported:
  - Scalars infront of variables cannot be written '5x' but must be written '5 * x' for example.
  - Powers should be written as follows: 'x ^ power'.
  - Similarly, +, -, and / operators must have a space between them and thier parameters.
  - There should never be a space immedietly following an open bracket, or preceding a closing bracket. For example '( x + 4 )' is invalid and should be written '(x + 4)' instead.
  - logarithms are supported and should be written log(base, x)
  - sin, cos, and tan are also supported and are written sin(x), cos(x), and tan(x) respectively.
