<h1>What is Function Helper?</h1>
<p>
  Function helper is a tool designed to help you with mathematical functions whatever the application.
  However, there is still much to come in the future, for example; functions can be applied in the form of matrices.
  Allowing for allot of new interesting functionality.
</p>

<h1>How do I use Function Helper?</h1>
<p>
  Firstly, you must make an account. At the sign in page click 'Register Account' at which point you will be redirected to the sign in page.
  Enter your email and password then click 'Sign up', shortly after you should recieve a email likely in your spam folder containing a link.
  Click the link (at your own risk given that you trust the email has come from Function Helper) which should verify your account.

  At this point you're all set to start using Function Helper! Just sign in and you should be redirected to the dashboard.

  Here you will be met with two columes, one side is the 'function-input' side. And the other is the 'data-input' side representing the two current methods
  of generating a function.
</p>

<h2> Function input (left) side </h2>
<p> Here you can simply enter a function as text however, there are some rules/syntax you must follow: </p>
<p> - Scalars in front of variables cannot be written '5x' but must be written '5 * x' for example. </p>
<p> - Powers should be written as follows: 'x ^ power'. Note that roots can be written: 'x ^ (1 / n)'. </p>
<p> - Similarly, +, -, *, and / operators must have a space between them and their parameters. </p>
<p> - There should never be a space immediately following an open bracket, or preceding a closing bracket. For example '( x + 4 )' is invalid and should be written '(x + 4)' instead. </p>
<p> - Logarithms are supported and should be written 'log(base, x)'. </p>
<p> - Sin, Cos, and Tan are also supported and are written sin(x), cos(x), and tan(x) respectively. </p>
<p> - Variables are required to be 1 character. </p>

<p>  Examples:
<p> - 'x ^ 2 - 1' [Has solutions] </p>
<p> - '(100 - x ^ 2) ^ 0.5' [Does not have solutions] </p>
<p> - 'tan(sin(x))' [Has solutions] </p>
<p> - 'cos(log(10, x))' [Has solutions] </p>
<p> - 'cos(log(b, x))' [Has solutions provided b > 0] </p>
<h2> Data Input (right) side </h2>
<p>
  Here you can enter a set of values for x and y, comma and/or space seperated, note that the sets should be the same length.
  Once the 'Generate' button is pressed, a function that goes through all the points specified is generated.
  Functions generated with more than 3 points are virtually unreadable, as the text output is the unsimplified LaGrange polynomial with sed points inputed in reverse polish notation.
</p>

<h1>Why use reverse polish notation? </h1>
<p>
  The advantage of reverse polish notation is that order does not matter.
  Which makes it harder to understand for us humans, likely taught conventonial algebraic notation, in return for it being easier for the computer to understand since
  it does not need to consider order (i.e BIDMAS) when it queries the function. However, when converting text to a function (i.e reverse polish notation) BIDMAS
  is used setting the function up for the correct order of operations.
</p>

<h1>How was Function Helper made? </h1>
<p>
  Function helper is developed using Angular 15 and Visual Studio 2022. With Firebase making it possible to have its very own webiste providing authentication and a database.
  It also relies on Chart.js for its beautiful graphs!
